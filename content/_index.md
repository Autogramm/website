Autogramm (Induction de grammaires descriptives à partir de corpus annotés) est un projet financé par l'[ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche)](https://anr.fr). Il a débuté début 2022 et va durer 4 ans.

# Résumé

The aim of this project is to automate, insofar as possible, the extraction of descriptive grammars and grammatical descriptions from annotated corpora, for the purpose of linguistic and typological studies. We aim for descriptions which 1) highlight the main properties of the corpus (and by extension the language or variety the corpus represents); 2) are easily understandable to a linguist; 3) can be visualized by texts, diagrams or tables, including grammatical databases generally oriented towards comparative and typological studies such as Grambank or Grammaticon (Haspelmath 2020); 4) and can range in size. Because these grammatical descriptions are induced from a corpus, they contain quantitative information associated with each observation made on that corpus, as well as relevant examples extracted from it.
