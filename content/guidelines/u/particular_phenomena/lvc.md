# Light verb constructions

A light verb is a verb that has little semantic content of its own and forms a construction with another word, usually a noun that brings the semantic value. The complements of these constructions are often attached to the noun (and not the verb), that is because:
* the noun can form a phrase with the complement : "le projectile a tendance à se mettre en travers" -> "cette tendance à se mettre en travers doit être rectifiée"
* it's the noun that is the predicate and controls the valency. In the previous example, HAVE is binary predicate, not a ternary predicate.
