title: Paradigmatical lists
---

In UD there are three relations 
[`reparandum`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/reparandum.html),
[`conj`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/conj.html),
[`appos`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/appos.html)
that SUD only uses for analysing written texts. 

These three relations work as paradigmatic lists. That's why in SUD for oral speech, we decided to gather these three relations under the relation `conj` to underline the similarity between the three.

We distinguish:
   * [`conj:dicto`](../conj_dicto) for disfluencies when the speaker corrects his speech (parallel to `reparandum` in written texts)
   * [`conj:coord`](../conj_coord) for elements connected by a coordinating conjunction (parallel to `conj` in written texts)
   * [`conj:appos`](../conj_appos) for appositional modifiers that serve to define better the previous noun (parallel to `appos` in written texts)

Note : for analysing oral speech we never use the `conj` relationship alone.
