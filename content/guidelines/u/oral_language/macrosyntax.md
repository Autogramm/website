title: Treating multiple propositions with no visible marker
---

In this part we will present relations that we use to link two elements that are placed side by side with no explicit marker of coordination, subordination, or argument relation with the head word. Ex: *I told him don't do it.* in this sentence we miss the usual marker *that*. Or in the following sentence: *My brother's children, you know he has two daughters, will come to visit* the part *you know he has two daughters* is inserted in the main sentence.

This phenomenon is frequent in languages and especially in oral speech. We gather these cases under the `parataxis` relation.

We distinguish:
   * [`parataxis:parenth`](../parataxis_parenth) for parenthetical clauses (that can form independant sentences)
   * [`parataxis:insert`](../parataxis_insert) for inserted clauses (that cannot form an independent sentece)
   * [`parataxis:obj`](../parataxis_obj) for attaching direct discourse

However, there are three other cases that are not gathered under the `parataxis` relationship. The following three relations may link related propositions with no marker, but the second proposition commutes also with elements that are not a proposition.
   * [`dislocated`](../dislocated)
   * [`vocative`](../vocative)
   * [`discourse`](../discourse)
