# The ExtPos feature

The ExtPos feature was introduced to facilitate the annotation of idioms, titles, and other multi-word units which behave like a certain part of speech, even though none of their constituents necessarily carry that part of speech. This feature allows the annotator to preserve the internal syntactic relationships between the various components of these units.
